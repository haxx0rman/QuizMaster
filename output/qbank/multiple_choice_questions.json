    "question": "Which of the following best describes Python's approach to variable assignment and data types?",
    "correct_answer": "Python uses dynamic typing, meaning variables can change their data type during runtime without explicit declaration.",
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "explanation": "This tests basic understanding of Python syntax. Dynamic typing is a core feature where you don't need to declare the type of variable explicitly; it's inferred at runtime. Other options might mention static typing or require explicit declarations, which are incorrect for Python.",

      "Python uses dynamic typing, meaning variables can change their data type during runtime without explicit declaration.",
      "Python uses static typing where data types are determined at compile time and cannot be changed during program execution",
      "Python implements weak typing where variables automatically convert between different data types without any type checking",
      "Python requires explicit type declaration before assigning values to variables, similar to languages like Java or C++"

    "question": "A data scientist wants to process large numerical datasets efficiently in Python. Which library would be most suitable for this task?",
    "correct_answer": "NumPy",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "explanation": "This requires application of knowledge about Python libraries. NumPy is specifically designed for numerical computing and offers efficient array operations, making it ideal for data scientists working with large datasets. While Pandas is also used in data science, it's primarily for data manipulation and analysis rather than raw numerical computation.",
