Machine Learning Fundamentals
    
    Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. 
    It is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) based on the idea that systems can learn from data, 
    identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
    
    Key Types of Machine Learning:
    1. Supervised Learning - Uses labeled data to train models
    2. Unsupervised Learning - Finds patterns in data without labels
    3. Reinforcement Learning - Learns through interaction with environment
    
    Common algorithms include:
    - Linear Regression
    - Decision Trees
    - Neural Networks
    - Support Vector Machines
