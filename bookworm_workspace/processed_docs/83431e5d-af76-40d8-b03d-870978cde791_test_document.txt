3. Large Community: Extensive libraries and frameworks available
4. Cross-platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux

Basic Concepts:
- Variables and Data Types
- Control Structures (if, for, while)
- Functions and Modules
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Exception Handling

Popular Libraries:
- NumPy: Numerical computing
- Pandas: Data manipulation
