# QuizMaster: Ragas-Inspired Question Generation System with LightRAG Integration

## üéì Overview

QuizMaster is a sophisticated question generation system inspired by the **Ragas** methodology, specifically designed for human learning and educational applications. Unlike traditional RAG testing frameworks, QuizMaster adapts Ragas' knowledge graph-based approach to create personalized, educational questions optimized for spaced repetition and progressive learning.

**üöÄ NEW: LightRAG Integration** - QuizMaster now seamlessly integrates with [LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG) for enhanced knowledge extraction and graph-based reasoning, providing superior performance and scalability for large knowledge bases.

## üî¨ Deep Dive into Ragas Methodology

### What We Learned from Ragas

Our comprehensive analysis of the [Ragas codebase](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) revealed several key methodological insights:

#### 1. **Knowledge Graph-Based Approach**

- **Ragas Core Principle**: Uses knowledge graphs as the foundation for test generation
- **Our Adaptation**: Extended this to educational knowledge graphs with learning-focused metadata
- **Key Components**:
  - Document processing and chunking
  - Entity and relationship extraction
  - Graph traversal for scenario generation

#### 2. **Query Complexity Types** (Ragas Framework)

- **Single-Hop Specific**: Direct factual questions from single sources
- **Single-Hop Abstract**: Conceptual questions requiring interpretation
- **Multi-Hop Specific**: Questions connecting multiple knowledge sources
- **Multi-Hop Abstract**: Complex reasoning across knowledge domains

#### 3. **Scenario-Based Generation**

- **Ragas Approach**: Generates "scenarios" as intermediate representations
- **Our Enhancement**: Added persona-aware scenario generation for educational contexts
- **Features**:
  - Graph clustering algorithms for multi-hop reasoning
  - Persona-based question style adaptation
  - Difficulty progression and scaffolding

#### 4. **Transform Pipeline Architecture**

- **Ragas Pattern**: Uses transforms to enrich knowledge graphs
- **Educational Adaptation**:
  - Headline extraction for topic identification
  - Keyphrase extraction for concept mapping
  - Relationship building for knowledge connections
