# QuizMaster Demo Results with UV

## ✅ Successfully Working Demos

We've successfully demonstrated the QuizMaster system using `uv` package management:

### 1. Basic Question Generation Demo
```bash
uv run python examples/basic_question_generation.py
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Knowledge graph creation (7 nodes, 7 edges)
- ✅ Question generation with multiple complexity levels
- ✅ Learning objective alignment
- ✅ Mock mode functionality working perfectly
- ✅ Different question types (single-hop, multi-hop, abstract)

### 2. Advanced Scenario Generation Demo
```bash
uv run python examples/advanced_scenario_demo.py
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Complex knowledge graph with 15 nodes and 16 edges
- ✅ Persona-based scenario generation (8 scenarios)
- ✅ 4 persona types working: Systems Analyst, Critical Thinker, Curious Student
- ✅ Knowledge graph traversal and pathway identification
- ✅ Educational complexity level analysis
- ✅ Progressive concept building pathways
