            Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms 
            that can learn and make decisions from data. There are three main types of machine 
            learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
            
            Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to 
            outputs. Common examples include classification and regression tasks. Classification 
            predicts discrete categories, while regression predicts continuous values.
            
            Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without labeled examples. Clustering 
            is a popular unsupervised technique that groups similar data points together.
            
            Reinforcement learning learns through interaction with an environment, receiving 
            rewards or penalties for actions taken.

            Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks.
            They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Deep learning
            refers to neural networks with many hidden layers.
            
            A typical neural network has an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an
            output layer. Each connection has a weight that determines the strength of the
            signal passed between neurons.
            
            Training involves adjusting these weights through backpropagation, which calculates
            gradients and updates weights to minimize error. Common applications include
            image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
            
            Overfitting is a common problem where the model memorizes training data but
            fails to generalize to new data. Techniques like dropout and regularization
            help prevent overfitting.
